# TameTallbirds
Don't Starve Mod to allow taming of Tallbirds

Ever raised a Tallbird? Probably not because in the base game raised Tallbirds are hostile and not much use. Tame Tallbirds seeks to fix that by making Tallbirds raised by the player loyal pets and potential combat allies.

Когда-либо поднимал Талльберд? Наверное, не потому, что в базовой игре поднятые Tallbirds враждебны и не очень полезны. Tame Tallbirds пытается исправить это, сделав Tallbirds поднятым игроком лояльными питомцами и потенциальными боевыми союзниками.

Tame Tallbirds:
  - Have similar combat stats to wild Tallbirds
  - Friendly with both tame and wild Tallbirds
  - Require food every few days (configurable)
  - Any food will heal the bird for a large amount
  - Will peck you if they are hungry (similar to teen birds)
  - Will not eat Tallbird Eggs
  - Will follow you into and out of caves
  - Will NOT follow you through the Seaworthy (SW)

Commands:
  - Follow: Tallbird will follow the player and defend them from harm.
  - Stay: Tallbird will remain in place, wandering about to guard the nearby area.
  - Retreat: (In Combat) Tallbird will cancel its attack and return to you. It will not reengage a new target for 10 seconds, unless you or it are attacked first.

NOTE: Be careful of starving your Tame Tallbirds near other player companions. Pecking you will often cause your other companions to attempt to defend you.
